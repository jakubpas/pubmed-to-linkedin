## PubMed/DOI Entry to LinkedIn Google Chrome Extension

(c) 2017 by jakubpas@gmail.com<Jakub Pas>

Allows conveniently adding publications to LinkedIn Profile via PubMed ID or DOI

1. Chrome plugin is based on abandoned Grease Monkey extension: http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/review/95938
2. It is currently working but MS frequently changes layout last days so no guarantee
3. Adding co-authors is not working properly. I can't figure out how it is done. If you know please contribute
4. When adding DOI no paper abstract is imported.
